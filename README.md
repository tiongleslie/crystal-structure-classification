# Crystal Structure Classification

## Introduction
This work contributes a novel descriptor XRD-Edge and Multi-stream DenseNet (MSDN) for crystal structure classification.

We provide several example source code as follows:
  1) XRD-Edge descriptor (see the folder 'XRD-Edge')
  2) the pre-trained model of MSDN for crystal structures classifcation (see the folder 'MSDN')
