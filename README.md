# Crystal Structure Classification

## Introduction
This work contributes a novel descriptor XRD-Edge and Multi-stream DenseNet (MSDN) for crystal structure classification.
Please cite the paper [1] when you are using our model in your research works.

We also provide the example of the source codes as follows:
  1) XRD-Edge descriptor (see the folder 'XRD-Edge')
  2) Pre-trained model of MSDN for crystal structures classifcation (see the folder 'MSDN')
