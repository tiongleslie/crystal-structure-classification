# Crystal Structure Classification

## Introduction
This work contributes a novel descriptor XRD-Edge and Multi-stream DenseNet (MSDN) for crystal structure classification.
Please cite the paper [1] if you are using our model in your research works.

We also provide the example of the source codes as follows:
  1) XRD-Edge descriptor (see the folder 'XRD-Edge')
  2) Pre-trained model of MSDN for crystal structures classification (see the folder '[MSDN]()')

### Compatibility
The codes are tested using Tensorflow-GPU r1.13 under Ubuntu OS 18.04 with Anaconda3 (Python 3.7).

### Library Dependency
  1) Anaconda (please refer to the guideline https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
  2) TensorFlow (please refer to the guideline https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)
  3) PIL - Python3 (please refer to https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pillow)
  4) NatSort - Python3 (please refer to https://pypi.org/project/natsort/)
  5) SciPy - Python3 (please refer to https://anaconda.org/anaconda/scipy)
